    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 medium onion, sliced thin</li>
      <li>1 lime, juiced</li>
      <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>⅓ teaspoon crushed saffron</li>
      <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
      <li>
        3 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes
      </li>
      <li>metal skewers</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine onion, lime juice, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and saffron in a
        large glass bowl. Mix in olive oil. Press chicken into the bowl lightly
        and cover with plastic wrap. Let marinate for 6 hours to overnight,
        mixing every few hours to make sure chicken is coated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove chicken from the bowl, shake off excess marinade, and discard
        marinade left in the bowl. Place chicken onto metal skewers, making sure
        it's not too tightly packed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook skewers on the preheated grill until chicken is browned and no
        longer pink in the center, turning as needed, 10 to 15 minutes total.
      </li>
